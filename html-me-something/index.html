    <h1>Traveling is one of my favorite things!</h1>
    <p>In 2016, I had a chance to head across the Atlantic to Italy on the spir of the moment.  As a linguist, I like to immerse myself in the language prior to any trip, but I didn't have a chance.  So off I went, full American style, oblivious to local language and culture! I also like to learn about the art of anyplace I visit, and Rome is a good place to find works scattered in throughout the cityscape!</p>

<h1>A Roman Holiday</h1>
<h2>An unexpected journey</h2>

<p>I took a last minute adventure to Rome a few years ago.  The journey began in St. Louis, Missouri on a cold February day.  I was delighted to arrive at the Hotel, The Westin Excelsior, on the Via Veneto, near the Spanish Steps and the Borghese Gardens Gallery. </p>

<h3>The Spanish Steps, A remodel and new rules </h3>
<p>The steps recently recieved a scrubbing and a new drainage system, funded by luxury jeweler Bulgari. Encouraged by Paolo Bulgari, the CEO of the famed brand, a new Roman law instituted to protect the cities architectural sites levies fines for sitting on the Spanish Steps.</p>

<p>Rome is littered with ancient artifacts.  This statue was defaced a milenia ago, the person's head was knocked off, so they could no longer breathe, thus, they could not recieve worship in the afterlife. A true symbolic death. This crow, however, knows how handsome he is, as the new head!</p>

<article> I truly enjoyed my time in Rome, and was fortunate enough to learn some Italian, enjoy spectacular food, sights and the company of terrific local people.  </article>
